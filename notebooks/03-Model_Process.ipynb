    "# 1. Convolutional Layer Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are a class of deep neural networks particularly suited for image recognition and classification tasks. They have revolutionized the field of computer vision by achieving remarkable performance in tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition. In this lecture, we will explore the fundamental concepts behind CNNs and understand how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convolutional Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "The core building blocks of CNNs are convolutional layers, which apply convolution operations to input images.\n",
    "Each convolutional layer consists of multiple filters (also known as kernels) that slide over the input image, performing element-wise multiplication and summation to produce feature maps.\n",
    "These filters capture different patterns and features such as edges, textures, and shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pooling Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers are used to downsample feature maps, reducing computational complexity and controlling overfitting.\n",
    "Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling, which respectively retain the maximum and average values within defined regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Activation Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex mappings between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "Popular activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fully Connected Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, allowing the network to learn high-level representations.\n",
    "These layers are typically used in the final stages of the network for classification or regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training Process:\n",
    "1. Forward Propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "        During forward propagation, input images are passed through the network, and computations are performed layer by layer to generate predictions.\n",
    "2. Loss Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The difference between the predicted output and the ground truth labels is quantified using a loss function, such as cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.\n",
    "3. Backward Propagation (Backpropagation):\n",
    "\n",
    "        Backpropagation is used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. These gradients are then used to update the parameters using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.\n",
    "4. Iterative Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The training process iterates through multiple epochs, with each epoch consisting of forward and backward propagation steps. Over time, the network learns to minimize the loss function and improve its performance on the training data.\n",

    "# 2. Semantic Segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic segmentation extends the capabilities of CNNs by providing pixel-level understanding of images, enabling the partitioning of an image into semantically meaningful regions and assigning class labels to individual pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pixel-Level Classification\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Unlike image classification tasks that assign a single label to the entire image, semantic segmentation assigns class labels to each pixel within the image, resulting in a detailed semantic understanding of the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encoder-Decoder Architectures\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Many semantic segmentation models employ encoder-decoder architectures, where the encoder extracts hierarchical features from the input image, and the decoder generates pixel-wise predictions by upsampling the feature maps to the original resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loss Functions\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Semantic segmentation models are trained using loss functions that measure the discrepancy between predicted pixel-wise labels and ground truth annotations. Common loss functions include cross-entropy loss, dice loss, and intersection-over-union (IoU) loss.\n"
